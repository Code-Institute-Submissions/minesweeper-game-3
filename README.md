### Personal Contribution and Experience

This project was developed entirely by me, without using any external sources, tutorials, or walkthroughs. I didnâ€™t research how to make a Minesweeper game; instead, I used my own logic to solve the problems. I enjoy figuring things out on my own because it keeps the project challenging and fun. All the design and code decisions reflect my own experience and skills, with no outside help.
