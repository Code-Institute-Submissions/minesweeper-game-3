# Minesweeper Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic Minesweeper game, built using the Textual framework to create a dynamic and interactive terminal-based user interface. The game runs in the browser, leveraging Heroku for deployment and xterm.js for rendering the terminal environment. This project aims to bring the retro gaming experience into a modern web-based context while maintaining the simplicity and challenge of the original Minesweeper.

## Personal Contribution and Experience

This project was developed entirely by me, without using any external sources, tutorials, or walkthroughs. I didnâ€™t research how to make a Minesweeper game; instead, I used my own logic to solve the problems. I enjoy figuring things out on my own because it keeps the project challenging and fun. All the design and code decisions reflect my own experience and skills, with no outside help.
